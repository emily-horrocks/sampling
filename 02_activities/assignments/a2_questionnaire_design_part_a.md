# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `#`1

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The survey aims to uncover key factors affecting job satisfaction and retention for entry and lower-level employees at the company. The focus will be on understanding the impact of compensation, work arrangements (remote vs. in-person), leadership support, and growth opportunities. Results will guide strategies to improve employee retention and satisfaction.

```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population: All current entry and lower-level employees in the company. (additional option would be past employers who have left but will consider that out of scope for current research) 
Sampling Frame: All entry and lower-level employees who have been with the company for at least three months.
Sampling Units: Individual employees within the frame.
Observation Units: individual responses provided by each sampled entry- and lower-level employee
Sampling Strategy: Simple random sampling of employees in the sampling frame to capture a diverse range of experiences. This will help ensure that the findings are representative of the current employee base, as their experiences directly affect retention.
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how satisfied are you with your current role in the company?
2. What aspects of your role do you find most fulfilling? (Select all that apply)
(Day-to-day Responsibilities, Work-life balance, Compensation, Team, Development opportunities, Other) 
3. How satisfied are you with your current work arrangement (remote, hybrid, or in-person)?
(Very satisfied, Somewhat satisfied, Neutral, Somewhat dissatisfied, Very dissatisfied) 
4. To what extent do you feel your compensation reflects the work you do?
(Very accurately, Somewhat accurately, Neutral, Somewhat inaccurately, Very inaccurately) 
5. How likely are you to stay with the company for another year?
(Very likely, Somewhat likely, Neutral, Somewhat unlikely, Very unlikely) 
6. Which of the following would make you feel more satisfied and likely to stay with the company? (Select all that apply)
(Higher salary, Additional benefits, Better remote or hybrid work options, More professional development opportunities, Stronger support from leadership, Improved company culture)
7. Is there any additional feedback youâ€™d like to share regarding compensation, work arrangements, or leadership? (Open-ended)
```
